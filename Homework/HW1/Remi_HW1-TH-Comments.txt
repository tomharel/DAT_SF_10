Extra Credit:
Slight issue - you're grouping by day + hour. So if we have more than one month, you might be lumping 9/22 and 10/22 as the same day and over count.
Instead I would group by date + hour.

In code:
"SELECT date(timestamp) AS date, \
                strftime('%H', timestamp) AS hour, \
                count(*) \
         FROM ga_hw_logins \
         GROUP BY date, hour \
         ORDER BY count(*) DESC \
         LIMIT 5"
