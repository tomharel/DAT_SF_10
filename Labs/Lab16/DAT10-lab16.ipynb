What tf-idf then does to solve that problem, is to scale down the frequent terms while scaling up the rare terms.

Now you know that, when the dot product between two different vectors is zero, they are orthogonal to each other (they have an angle of 90 degrees), this is a very neat way to check the orthogonality of different vectors. It is also important to note that we are using 2D examples, but the most amazing fact about it is that we can also calculate angles and similarity between vectors in higher dimensional spaces, and that is why math let us see far than the obvious even when we can\u2019t visualize or imagine what is the angle between two vectors with twelve dimensions for instance."
